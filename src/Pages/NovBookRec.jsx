                            Reading a book has always been a source of enjoyment. When we immerse ourselves in a book,
                            we learn, grow, and escape from our everyday stressors. Yet, why do many of us gravitate
                            towards endless scrolling or doing something mind-numbing instead of reading? Many of us may
                            feel exhausted from daily life and don&#39;t want to engage in a thought-provoking activity, yet these
                            choices can lead to unwanted habits.

                            We were taught the importance of reading as children, but why do we forget the lessons as we
                            grow older? We often go long periods without reading, which is odd considering reading has
                            many benefits, including improving our creativity and assisting us in concentrating on everyday
                            tasks. When we read, we gain wisdom, enhance vocabulary, and help reduce our stress. It
                            increases our mental dictionary, which allows us to articulate our ideas and thoughts, leading us
                            to be better writers, advocates, and conversationalists. Not only this, reading is linked to a
                            lowered risk of dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s! Many forms of reading include books, articles,
                            newspapers, and magazines.

                                  1950s, during the expulsion of the prime minister. (I love this book: it is genuinely well-written
                                  and will leave you thinking for days.)
