                              I’m passionate about skincare and willing to invest in it. Growing up, I struggled with various
                              skincare concerns, from acne to dark circles, which often made me feel ashamed. It&#39;s fascinating
                              how people will give you unsolicited advice or point out your insecurities. Where do some of
                              y&#39;all find the audacity? However, these experiences ultimately led me to understand skincare
                              better and discover products that truly work.
                          </p>

                          <p className="text-start text-xl eb-garamond-normal mt-5 leading-relaxed">
                              Like many teenagers, I tried numerous products, hoping my skin issues would disappear, yet
                              they never worked. I didn’t understand that most of these products only worsened my skin and
                              caused more damage. It’s essential to note that teen acne is primarily caused by hormonal
                              changes during puberty, specifically the increase in testosterone, which triggers acne by
                              enlarging oil glands and affecting the skin. Other factors that can irritate the skin include stress,
                              diet, genes, medication, and the products we use. Most people will experience acne well into
                              their 20s and even into adulthood.

                              This sunscreen has quickly become one of my favorites. It doesn’t leave a white cast and blends
                              seamlessly into the skin. With SPF 50, it provides excellent sun protection while feeling light
                              and comfortable on the face! (Normal to dry skin)

                              After a long day, I love using these pads. They are both hydrating and gently remove the day&#39;s
                              residue. For those with acne, applying a pad to a pimple for 3-5 minutes can accelerate its
                              healing and reduce redness. These pads are especially great for sensitive skin, offering calming
                              relief that will minimize irritation.

                              I’ve been using this eye cream for the last 9 months, and it works. It helps get rid of dark circles
                              and is a great moisturizer for nighttime. With retinol in the formula, it’s perfect for night use and
                              also helps with fine lines. I’d definitely buy this eye cream again—it&#39;s lasted me over 9 months!

                              Given my dry skin, I preferred this cream over the COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Essence. The

                              essence has a thinner formula, which might be better suited for normal to oily skin, while the all-
